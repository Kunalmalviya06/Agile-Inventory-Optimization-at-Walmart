# Real-Time Inventory Optimization at Walmart Using Agile Framework

## Project Background

Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest retailer, faces operational challenges in efficiently managing inventory across its thousands of stores worldwide. With fluctuating customer demand, promotional activities, and external factors like weather impacting sales, Walmart's operations team is under pressure to maintain optimal stock levels. This involves avoiding overspending on excess inventory while minimizing stockouts that can lead to lost sales.

To maintain a competitive edge and meet growing customer demands, Walmart aims to implement real-time demand forecasting by analyzing historical sales data. This process includes understanding customer purchasing behavior, the influence of external factors such as weather, and evaluating the effectiveness of promotions. The analysis will guide Walmart's inventory decisions, enabling them to streamline operations, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## Objectives

- **Real-time Demand Forecasting**: Implement a system to predict customer demand effectively.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze historical sales data to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Cost Reduction**: Optimize inventory levels to minimize excess stock and reduce costs.
- **Enhance Customer Satisfaction**: Ensure product availability to meet customer needs.

## Methodology

This project follows an **Agile methodology**, broken down into sprints for continuous value delivery and adaptation to insights throughout the process. The key steps include:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical sales data from Walmart's databases.
2. **Data Analysis**: Use statistical methods and data visualization tools to analyze the collected data.
3. **Demand Forecasting**: Implement forecasting models that account for customer behavior, promotions, and external factors.
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Regularly review and improve forecasting models based on new data and insights.

## Team Contributions

As data analysts, the team is tasked with:

- Analyzing the dataset and discovering key insights.
- Delivering actionable recommendations to improve inventory management.
- Collaborating with stakeholders to refine and adapt the project scope based on feedback.

## Conclusion

This project aims to leverage data analytics and Agile methodologies to optimize inventory management at Walmart, ultimately improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
